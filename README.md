## Compatibility
I have run this game on several windows 10 systems but it's not guaranteed on windows 11.
## Implementations
for GUI I used a wrapper class for SDL2 named SBDL which simplifies the usage of SDL2.this libray is written by two masters student here at SBU.
I used linked list which was used for making the game's memory dynamic.
## Abilities
+ creating different users
+ saving the boards
+ build almost infinite number of boards and users (*limited to your heap size*)
+ leaderboard
